        /* Hunting the Manticore - INSTRUCTIONS
         
         The Uncoded One’s airship, the Manticore, has begun an all-out attack on the city of Consolas. It must be
destroyed, or the city will fall. Only by combining Mylara’s prototype, Skorin’s cannon, and your
programming skills will you have a chance to win this fight. You must build a program that allows one
user—the pilot of the Manticore—to enter the airship’s range from the city and a second user—the city’s
defenses—to attempt to find what distance the airship is at and destroy it before it can lay waste to the
town.
The first user begins by secretly establishing how far the Manticore is from the city, in the range 0 to 100.
The program then allows a second player to repeatedly attempt to destroy the airship by picking the
range to target until either the city of Consolas or the Manticore is destroyed. In each attempt, the player
is told if they overshot (too far), fell short (not far enough), or hit the Manticore. The damage dealt to the
Manticore depends on the turn number. For most turns, 1 point of damage is dealt. But if the turn number
is a multiple of 3, a fire blast deals 3 points of damage; a multiple of 5, an electric blast deals 3 points of
damage, and if it is a multiple of both 3 and 5, a mighty fire-electric blast deals 10 points of damage. The
Manticore is destroyed after taking 10 points of damage.
However, if the Manticore survives a turn, it will deal a guaranteed 1 point of damage to the city of
Consolas. The city can only take 15 points of damage before being annihilated.
Before a round begins, the user should see the current status: the current round number, the city’s health,
and the Manticore’s health.
A sample run of the program is shown below. The first player gets a chance to place the Manticore:

Player 1, how far away from the city do you want to station the Manticore? 32
At this point, the display is cleared, and the second player gets their chance:
Player 2, it is your turn.

Objectives:
•
Establish the game’s starting state: the Manticore begins with 10 health points and the city with 15.
The game starts at round 1.
•
Ask the first player to choose the Manticore’s distance from the city (0 to 100). Clear the screen
afterward.
•
Run the game in a loop until either the Manticore’s or city’s health reaches 0.
•
Before the second player’s turn, display the round number, the city’s health, and the Manticore’s
health.
•
Compute how much damage the cannon will deal this round: 10 points if the round number is a
multiple of both 3 and 5, 3 if it is a multiple of 3 or 5 (but not both), and 1 otherwise. Display this to
the player.
•
Get a target range from the second player, and resolve its effect. Tell the user if they overshot (too
far), fell short, or hit the Manticore. If it was a hit, reduce the Manticore’s health by the expected
amount.
•
If the Manticore is still alive, reduce the city’s health by 1.
•
Advance to the next round.
•
When the Manticore or the city’s health reaches 0, end the game and display the outcome.
•
Use different colors for different types of messages.
•
Note: This is the largest program you have made so far. Expect it to take some time!
•
Note: Use methods to focus on solving one problem at a time.
•
Note: This version requires two players, but in the future, we will modify it to allow the computer
to randomly place the Manticore so that it can be a single-player game.
